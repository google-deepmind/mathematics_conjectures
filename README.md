# Advancing mathematics by guiding human intuition with AI

This repo contains two [colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/)
notebooks which accompany the paper, available online at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04086-x

Both the representation theory and knot theory colabs retrain an ML model from
scratch and recreate our published results by our same intermediary steps.

## Installation

No installation is required; the notebook files can be opened on the Colab site
from a copy of these files uploaded from a local machine, saved in google drive
or directly from this github repo. Alternatively they can be accessed via these links:

* Knot theory - https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/deepmind/mathematics_conjectures/blob/main/knot_theory.ipynb
* Representation theory - https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/deepmind/mathematics_conjectures/blob/main/representation_theory.ipynb

## Usage

Once the notebook has loaded, simply follow the comments along and execute all
of the cells from top to bottom.
